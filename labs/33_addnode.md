## Lab 3.3: Add Nodes

Adding a node to the existing Kubernetes cluster is as easy as it was in [Lab 2.1: Provision a new Kubernetes cluster](21_provision.md).

### Add node to cluster

Open again the "Edit Cluster" page for your cluster. On the very bottom, you find `Customize Node Run Command`.

Choose the Node Role you want to use. For this lab, we wanna add a new worker node. Copy then the Docker run command and execute it on your `userX-k8snode3` node. Rancher will then deploy the worker components on the node. After some minutes, the new node will be visible and ready for your workload.
